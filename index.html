    <!-- Chosen Palette: Washington Post Classic (Black, White, Gray, with Red Accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard design was chosen to provide a comprehensive, at-a-glance overview of the portfolio's status. This structure prioritizes immediate access to key metrics and project details. The user flow is designed to be intuitive, starting with high-level KPIs, moving to a visual breakdown of project statuses, and finally allowing for detailed exploration through a filterable project list. The addition of Program Type and Location filters enhances this exploration, allowing for multi-criteria searching. This approach enhances usability by presenting the most critical information upfront while enabling deeper dives as needed. -->
